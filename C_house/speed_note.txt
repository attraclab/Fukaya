vx = 0.1 m/s

it took 3 minutes 18 seconds to complete 1 1/2 lane  => 198 seconds

delay on 1st to 5th lane need 51 frames 
			=> 198 sec / 51 frames = 3.88 sec delay to capture 1 frame
			=> 195 sec / 51 frames = 3.78 sec delay to capture 1 frame

delay on 6th lane need 48 frames => 198 sec / 48 frames = 4.12 sec delay to capture 1 frame

delay on 7th lane same as 1st-5th lanes


1th to 7th lanes, the bot using 198 seconds because shorter
8th to 30th lanes, the bot using around 3 mins 32sec (212 secs) ~ 3 mins 39sec (219 seconds)

8th to 30th lanes need 57 frames  
			=> 212 sec / 57 frames = 3.72 sec delay to capture 1 frame
			=> 219 sec / 57 frames = 3.84 sec delay to capture 1 frame
